## 🌟 Overview

**CogniStream** is a **real-time, multimodal Heads-Up Display (HUD)** that works as a **proactive AI coding partner**.  
Instead of pasting code into a chat window, CogniStream **watches your screen**, understands what you are doing, and **speaks intelligent suggestions instantly**.

Built exclusively for the **Gemini 3 Global Hackathon**, CogniStream demonstrates how Gemini 3 can power **continuous visual reasoning**, **hands-free assistance**, and **ultra-low latency feedback**.

## ⚡ Quick Start (No Setup Required)
Want to try CogniStream instantly without installing Python?

👉 Download the ready-to-run Windows executable from the **Latest Release**:  
🔗 https://github.com/disha-katkade/CogniStream/releases

**Folder Structure Example:**
- 📂 CogniStream_Folder
  - 📄 CogniStream.exe
  - 📄 keys.txt (Your API key goes here)
    
> Simply place your Gemini API key inside `keys.txt`, launch `CogniStream.exe`, and the HUD will start immediately.

## 🧠 Why Gemini 3?

CogniStream is only feasible with **Gemini 3’s multimodal vision and fast reasoning**.

| Traditional AI Assistants | CogniStream + Gemini 3 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Manual prompts required | Fully automatic |
| Text-only understanding | Vision + reasoning |
| High response latency | Real-time feedback |
| Passive chatbot | Proactive AI partner |

Gemini 3 enables continuous screen understanding and instant analysis—something not practical with text-only or slower models.

## 🔗 Gemini 3 Integration

| Capability | Usage in CogniStream |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Model** | Gemini 3 Flash |
| **Vision** | Analyzes live screen captures from IDEs and UI tools |
| **Reasoning** | `thinking_level="HIGH"` for deep logic and design analysis |
| **Latency** | Optimized for near-instant responses |
| **Multimodal Output** | Visual input → text insights → voice feedback |

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Proactive Debugging**  
Automatically detects syntax errors, logic flaws, and warnings while you code.

## 🚀 How to Run CogniStream
To use the standalone version of CogniStream without setting up a Python environment, follow these steps:

### 1. Download the Executable
Go to the Releases section on the right side of this page.

Download ```CogniStream.exe```.

### 2. Set Up Your API Key
For security, the application does not store an API key. You must provide your own:
- Create a new text file in the same folder as the ```.exe```.
- Rename this file to ```keys.txt```.
- Open the file and paste your Gemini API Key inside (get one at Google AI Studio).
- Save and close the file.

### 3. Launch
Double-click ```CogniStream.exe```.

The AI will initialize and greet you once the connection is established.
